# Data Structures

I reckon there are probably some mistakes to be corrected in this repo, however I'm not looking into it actively anymore - at least since 05-Aug-2021, when I lost some implementations after I had to restore my machine without pushing them here.

## Collection of a few data structures implemented in C

- [Linked lists](linked-list)

- [Double-ended queue](double-ended-queue)

- [Binary search tree](binary-search-tree)

- [Queue](queue)

- [Stack](stack)
